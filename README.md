# An Implementation of the Scheme Interpreter In Python

This is old code from 2018. As part of [Berkeley's Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs course](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa18/), I had to complete the implementation of a scheme interpreter by filling the gaps in staff-provided code. I was so excited that I decided to write my own interpreter without looking at any of the given code!
